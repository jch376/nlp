    "## What are regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are sequences of characters that are used to search for a set of strings in a larger text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are working with Python, but they can be applied using other programming languages, text editors and command-line tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are they useful for text analysis applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use them in pre-processing to clean your data (e.g. removing menus or headers from a web-page you have scraped). You can use regular expressions to normalise your text (e.g. replacing different ways in which a Russian name like Евгений is rendered in English, Yevgeny, Yevgeniy, Evgeny, Evgeni, Evgeniy, Eugeny, with a standardised form). You can use regular expressions to tokenise text or extract features for analysis or modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Super-quick introduction through examples\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will take you through some examples of using regular expressions using Python. This is intended to be a brief introduction. You will find lots of opportunities to put regular expressions to use in collecting and preparing texts for analysis."
